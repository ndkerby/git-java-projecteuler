* PROBLEM 6:
*    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
*       1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
*    
*    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
*        (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
*    
*    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
*    ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
*    
*    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
*    one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
